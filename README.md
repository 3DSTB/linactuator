# Linear Actuator

Simple and cheap linear actuator with M4 threaded rod.
Inside are put 2 hex nuts and a spring between them.
Try rotating one nut in all 6 positions to experimentally
find best option, least fricition and still no gap.

This actuator should be a better replacement for factory 
default Z-actuator found in 3D printer "Turnigy Fabrikator ][ Mini".
