# Linear Actuator

Simple and cheap linear actuator with M4 threaded rod.
Inside are put 2 hex nuts and a spring between them.
Try rotating one nut in all 6 positions to experimentally
find best option, least fricition and still no gap.

This actuator should be a better replacement for factory 
default Z-actuator found in 3D printer "Turnigy Fabrikator ][ Mini".

Attached is also 3D printable removal tool to ease disassembling
factory default Z-actuator using a M4 screw to get original elongated M4 
brass nuts out of it.
